How to see tests results:
- Use VS code;
- Get this plugins: Live Server and Browser Preview;
- Click: "Live Server" button from VS Code. 

Lessons learnt:
- you can skip a test/test suite by adding 'x' in front of it (e.g: "xdescribe"; "xit") - helps while debugging;
- spies (spyOn) are useful when dealing with third parties/APIs;
- use mocking to don't need to hit the servers all the time;
- testing things that are asynchronous is where mocks excel at;
